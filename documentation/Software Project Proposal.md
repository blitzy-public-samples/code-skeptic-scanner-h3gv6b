### BUDGET CONSIDERATIONS

1. API Usage Fluctuations: The costs associated with Twitter API and LLM API usage are estimates based on projected usage. Actual costs may vary depending on the volume of tweets processed and the number of responses generated. We will implement usage monitoring and alerts to manage this risk.

2. Cloud Infrastructure Scaling: As the system scales, there may be a need for additional cloud resources. We have included a buffer in the cloud services budget, but significant increases in data volume could necessitate additional spending.

3. Regulatory Compliance: Changes in data protection regulations or Twitter's terms of service may require additional development work to ensure compliance. The contingency budget is partly allocated to address such potential changes.

4. Extended Development Time: If the project timeline extends beyond the estimated duration, additional labor costs may be incurred. We will mitigate this risk through careful project management and regular progress reviews.

5. Third-Party Integration Challenges: Unforeseen difficulties in integrating with Twitter or Notion APIs could lead to additional development time. We have factored in some buffer time, but significant issues could impact the budget.

6. Currency Fluctuations: For any services priced in foreign currencies (e.g., some cloud services), exchange rate fluctuations could affect the final cost in USD. We will monitor this and adjust as necessary.

7. Scope Changes: Any significant changes to the project scope requested by the client may impact the budget. We will manage this through a formal change request process, with associated cost estimates provided for approval before implementation.

To manage these budget considerations:

- We will provide monthly budget reports to track spending against projections.
- The project manager will conduct regular risk assessments to identify and mitigate potential budget impacts.
- We have included a 10% contingency fund to address unforeseen expenses or minor scope adjustments.
- Any potential budget overruns will be communicated to the client promptly, along with proposed solutions or adjustments.

By maintaining transparent communication and proactive management of these budget considerations, we aim to deliver the Code Skeptic Scanner within the proposed budget while maintaining flexibility to address challenges as they arise.
