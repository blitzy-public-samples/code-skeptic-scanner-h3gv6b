    O --> P{Post Response?}
    P -->|Yes| Q[Post Response to Twitter]
    P -->|No| R[Save for Later]
    Q --> B
    R --> B
```

This flowchart outlines the main processes of the Code Skeptic Scanner:

1. The system continuously monitors the Twitter Streaming API for tweets.
2. When a relevant tweet is identified, it checks if it meets the popularity threshold.
3. If the tweet meets the threshold, the system extracts and analyzes the tweet information.
4. The tweet is assigned a Doubt Rating and stored in the Notion database.
5. A Notion notification is triggered to alert the team.
6. An AI-generated response is created using the LLM-based response module.
7. The generated response is stored in the Notion database.
8. Optionally, the response can undergo manual review and editing.
9. The response is then either posted to Twitter or saved for later use.
10. The process continues in a loop, returning to monitoring for new tweets.

This process ensures that all relevant tweets are captured, analyzed, and responded to in a timely and efficient manner, while allowing for human oversight and intervention when necessary. The system's modular design, implemented using Python for the backend processes and React with TypeScript and Tailwind CSS for the user interface, allows for easy scaling and modification of individual components as needed.
