## SECURITY CONSIDERATIONS

### AUTHENTICATION AND AUTHORIZATION

The Code Skeptic Scanner will implement a robust authentication and authorization system to ensure secure access to the application and its resources.

1. Authentication:
   - OAuth 2.0 will be used for user authentication, integrated with Google Cloud Identity Platform.
   - Multi-factor authentication (MFA) will be mandatory for all administrative accounts.
   - JSON Web Tokens (JWT) will be used for maintaining user sessions.

2. Authorization:
   - Role-Based Access Control (RBAC) will be implemented to manage user permissions.
   - The following roles will be defined:
     - Admin: Full access to all system features and configurations
     - Analyst: Access to tweet analysis and response generation
     - Viewer: Read-only access to dashboards and reports

```mermaid
graph TD
    A[User] -->|Authenticates| B[Google Cloud Identity Platform]

    C -->|Checks Role| D{RBAC}
    D -->|Admin| E[Full Access]
    D -->|Analyst| F[Limited Access]
    D -->|Viewer| G[Read-only Access]
```

3. API Security:
   - API access will be controlled using JWT tokens with a maximum lifespan of 1 hour.
   - API rate limiting will be implemented to prevent abuse.

### DATA SECURITY

The Code Skeptic Scanner will employ multiple layers of security to protect sensitive information:

1. Data Encryption:
   - All data at rest will be encrypted using AES-256 encryption in Google Cloud Storage and Cloud Firestore.
   - All data in transit will be encrypted using TLS 1.3 or higher.

2. Data Classification:
   - Data will be classified into three categories: Public, Internal, and Confidential.
   - Access controls and encryption levels will be applied based on data classification.

| Data Classification | Example | Access Control | Encryption |
|---------------------|---------|----------------|------------|
| Public | Tweet content | All authenticated users | In transit |
| Internal | Sentiment analysis results | Analysts and Admins | At rest and in transit |
| Confidential | User credentials | Admins only | At rest and in transit with additional key management |

3. Data Masking:
   - Sensitive user information will be masked in logs and non-production environments.

4. Data Retention and Deletion:
   - Automated data retention policies will be implemented to ensure data is not kept longer than necessary.
   - Secure data deletion procedures will be in place for removing data upon request or after the retention period.

### SECURITY PROTOCOLS

The following security protocols will be implemented to maintain system security:

1. Network Security:
   - Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) will be used to isolate the application's network resources.
   - Cloud NAT will be implemented to control egress traffic.
   - Web Application Firewall (WAF) will be deployed to protect against common web exploits.

2. Monitoring and Logging:
   - Google Cloud Security Command Center will be used for continuous security monitoring and threat detection.
   - Comprehensive logging will be implemented using Google Cloud Logging.
   - Security logs will be retained for a minimum of 90 days for audit purposes.

3. Vulnerability Management:
   - Regular vulnerability scans will be conducted using Google Cloud Security Scanner.
   - A responsible disclosure program will be established for reporting security vulnerabilities.

4. Incident Response:
   - An incident response plan will be developed and regularly updated.
   - Automated alerts will be configured for potential security incidents.

5. Secure Development Practices:
   - All developers will follow OWASP secure coding guidelines.
   - Regular security training will be provided to the development team.
   - Static code analysis tools will be integrated into the CI/CD pipeline.

6. Third-Party Security:
   - All third-party integrations will undergo a security assessment before implementation.
   - Regular security reviews of third-party services will be conducted.

7. Compliance:
